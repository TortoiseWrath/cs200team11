		<p>
			Updating records, billing and sending reports will be computerized in the ChocAn server. All of this information is stored on drive in the ChocAn data center. For the ChocAn data center a server mainframe, and networking equipment will be needed. The software on the ChocAn server will interact with accounting services, EFT data software and communication software to push information to other systems. Operators will interact with the system at the data center while the software is in interactive mode. Providers and managers can interact with the software through remote terminals.
